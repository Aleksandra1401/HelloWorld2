"A man must first of all understand certain things. He has thousands of *false* ideas and *false* conceptions, chiefly about **himself**, and he must get rid of some of them before beginning to acquire anything *new*. Otherwise the new will be built on a *wrong foundation* and the result will be worse than before. To speak the truth is the most difficult thing in the world; one must study a great deal and for a long time in order to speak the truth. The wish alone is **not enough**. To speak the truth one must know *what the truth is and what a lie is*, and first of all in *oneself*. ***And this nobody wants to know***." ~*G. I. Gurdjieff*
